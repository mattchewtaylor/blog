      <p class="lh-copy mid-gray fl w-90 pa0 mt0 mb5">I'm a multidisciplinary designer and strategist with 5+ years of experience in UX research, design, and code.

      <p class="lh-copy mid-gray fl w-90 pa0 mt0 mb5">I graduated with a BFA in graphic design back in 2014 and have been designing digital stuff on a pretty regular basis ever since. Former senior designer at <a class="custom-gradient-text shine fw5 dim link-underline" href="http://www.illustriadesigns.com/" target="_blank">Illustria</a> where I worked alongside brands such as Alaska Airlines, Symphony Commerce, and ZOZI.

      <span class="fl w-10 pa0 f3">✏️</span>
      <p class="lh-copy mid-gray fl w-90 pa0 mt0 mb5">I built a simple <a class="custom-gradient-text shine fw5 dim link-underline" href="{{ "/blog/" | relative_url }}">blog</a> to occasionally write down my thoughts about design, life, and everything else in between. I also x-post to <a class="custom-gradient-text shine fw5 dim link-underline" href="https://medium.com/@mattchewtaylor" target="_blank">Medium</a> if that's more your thing. Trying to keep it weekly but you know how that goes.</p>

      <span class="fl w-10 pa0 f3">💻</span>
      <p class="lh-copy mid-gray fl w-90 pa0 mt0 mb5">I spend time learning how to code wherever and whenever I can. It started as a need to prototype my ideas in the browser but quickly blossomed into a primary interest and hobby. I built this site by hand and have been involved in various open source projects over the years. I recently picked myself up a <a class="custom-gradient-text shine fw5 dim link-underline" href="https://github.com/mattchewtaylor" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and intend to make a few commits every week.</p>

      <p class="lh-copy mid-gray fl w-90 pa0 mt0 mb5">When I'm not doing the design thing, I'm usually planning my next big snowboarding trip, <a class="custom-gradient-text shine fw5 dim link-underline" href="https://www.instagram.com/mattchewtaylor/" target="_blank">flying my drone</a>, or getting into trouble with my best friend and partner in crime - <a class="custom-gradient-text shine fw5 dim link-underline" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BR_hG_tlC93/?taken-by=mattchewtaylor" target="_blank">Remi</a>.</p>
