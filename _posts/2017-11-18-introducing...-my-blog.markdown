Hey there, my name is Matt.

I'm really not sure how to start this thing. Writing makes me incredibly nervous. It's difficult, time consuming, and I'm generally pretty bad at it. But, in a weird way, *that's okay* - I've never really done it before.
<!--excerpt-->
I'm going to cut myself a bit of slack to start off with and say it's all right to be bad at it. In fact, I kind of *hope* I am bad at it so I can look back a year from now and say "holy shit... what was I doing!?"
<br>
<br>
## <span style="color: black;">So, what are you doing?</span>
Well, I'm building a blog. It's going to be more than that... in the *future* - but for now it's a blog. One of my biggest goals for 2018 is to... well, practice writing. But not just writing for writings sake, it definitely goes deeper than that.
<br>
<br>
I'm a digital designer by day, the majority of my creativity is expressed through the notes in my notebook and some boxes on a screen. But I want to learn how to externalize those notes, how to share my thought process behind some of those boxes, and get as many people as I can involved in the conversation.
<br>
<br>
I've had quite the busy year behind me and have set some pretty lofty goals for my future self. I'm going to use this blog as an outlet to share everything I've been up to, and as a way to hold myself accountable for everything I plan to do. I'm going to learn as much as I possibly can and hopefully provide a bit of knowledge and a few resources in return.
<br>
<br>
## <span style="color: black;">Cool... so who are you again?</span>

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
