# <span style="color: black;">Introduction</span>
## <span style="color: black;">Project overview</span>
Despite the urgency of the matter, the refugee resettlement process often consists of months and months of waiting, hours of preparation, bottomless stacks of forms and materials, and countless interviews and appointments.

The International Rescue Committee came to ISL looking for a digital solution that would bridge the gap between pre-departure and post-arrival refugee resettlement experiences, and increase comprehension around core cultural transition information. The result was [SettleIn](https://settlein.app/).

## <span style="color: black;">The problem</span>
A key tenet of IRCâ€™s cultural orientation program for refugees is self-sufficiencyâ€”but given the stress, complexities, and information overload that go along with the resettlement process, that vital information can be difficult to process and retain over time. The refugee resettlement program lacks a digital orientation resource that would help refugee families acclimate to their new environment and access relevant CO materials any time on their preferred mobile device in order to accelerate their path to self-reliance.

## <span style="color: black;">The goal</span>
Effectively communicate and increase refugee comprehension around critical pre- and post-arrival resettlement information.

# <span style="color: black;">Research</span>
## <span style="color: black;">Kick-off</span>
In order to thoughtfully approach the challenge at hand, we embarked on a comprehensive discovery phase that included interviewing and surveying stakeholders around the globe, comparative analyses, familiarizing ourselves with cultural orientation curriculum, and lots of research.

## <span style="color: black;">Interviews & surveys</span>
We began with stakeholder interviews and cultural orientation surveys to define our research objectives and build consensus about what problems weâ€™re focused on solving. This was the time for us to evaluate any assumptions around the project goals and for the team to gain insight into the efficacy and impact of the cultural orientation process and how it contributes to refugeeâ€™s ability to acclimate in their new environment. [Here's an example]() of a stakeholder interview script we used.

## <span style="color: black;">Comparative analysis</span>
We carried out a comparative analysis to get a sense of the current landscape of digital products & services focused on cultural orientation and crisis relief. We needed to understand what other services were doing, how they were doing it, and who they were doing it for. When it came to the products themselves, we took stock of everythingâ€”supported languages, device platforms, geo-location services, security protocols, any personalization or gamification elements, and much more.

## <span style="color: black;">Provisional personas</span>
We moved into a series of personas to capture our intended audiences and their respective wants, needs, and frustrations. We focused mainly on refugees, cultural orientation trainers overseas, and case workers helping stateside.

## <span style="color: black;">Key observations</span>
Upon completion of the initial discovery phase, we arrived at a set of strategic insights that ultimately defined our UX and design direction for the entire product:

# <span style="color: black;">Designing the experience</span>
## <span style="color: black;">Facilitating repetition</span>
We implemented the Tell, Show, Do, Apply learning model as a lesson framework for its proven ability to help users retain information over time. The sheer simplicity and efficacy of the Tell, Show, Do, Apply model naturally lends itself to mobile app design. This framework served as our North Star when deciding how to approach content for our lessons.

## <span style="color: black;">Giving control the user</span>
To many, refugee resettlement is a sensitive, controversial processâ€”especially from a privacy standpoint. Due to user confidentiality precautions, it was too risky to store personal information in the application. Instead, we made it easy for users to skip around to lessons that interest them or pick up where they left without having to log in.
