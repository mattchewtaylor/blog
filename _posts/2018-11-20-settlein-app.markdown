# <span style="color: black;">Introduction</span>
## <span style="color: black;">Project overview</span>
Despite the urgency of the matter, the refugee resettlement process often consists of months and months of waiting, hours of preparation, bottomless stacks of forms and materials, and countless interviews and appointments.

The *International Rescue Committee (IRC)* came to ISL looking for a digital solution that would bridge the gap between pre-departure and post-arrival refugee resettlement experiences, and increase comprehension around core cultural transition information. The result was [SettleIn](https://settlein.app/).

## <span style="color: black;">The problem</span>
A key tenet of IRCâ€™s cultural orientation (CO) program for refugees is self-sufficiencyâ€”but given the stress, complexities, and information overload that go along with the resettlement process, that vital information can be difficult to process and retain over time.

The refugee resettlement program lacks a digital orientation resource that would help refugee families acclimate to their new environment and access relevant CO materials any time on their preferred mobile device in order to accelerate their path to self-reliance.

## <span style="color: black;">The goal</span>
Effectively communicate and increase refugee comprehension around critical pre- and post-arrival resettlement information. My role during the project was to support the Sr. UX Strategist and interactive design team through all phases of discovery, research, design, and testing heading into future sprints.

# <span style="color: black;">Research</span>
## <span style="color: black;">Kick-off</span>
In order to thoughtfully approach the challenge at hand, we embarked on a comprehensive discovery phase that included interviewing and surveying stakeholders around the globe, comparative analyses, familiarizing ourselves with cultural orientation curriculum, and lots of research.

</div>
<p class="tc f6">A short brainstorming exercise that helped both teams prioritize orientation content and determine milestones for the project.</p>

## <span style="color: black;">Interviews & surveys</span>
We began with stakeholder interviews and CO surveys to define our research objectives and build consensus about what problems weâ€™re focused on solving. This was the time for us to evaluate any assumptions around the project goals and for the team to gain insight into the efficacy and impact of the cultural orientation process and how it contributes to refugeeâ€™s ability to acclimate in their new environment.

This was a tag-team effort from both the ISL and IRC team so we needed to create a script that could be used asynchronously by multiple different people. [Here's an example](/assets/img/posts/07-settlein-app/07-stakeholder-script.pdf) of a script used during this process.

### <span style="color: black;">Key takeaways</span>
We learned that an **internet connection could not be relied upon** and that many refugees **do not have access to a personal device**. We needed to ensure that the experience was available offline and that the app could track individual learning progress across multiple profiles.

Additionally, given the current social climateâ€”we needed to be careful about **storing any personally identifiable information**.
<br>
<br>

## <span style="color: black;">Comparative analysis</span>
We carried out a comparative analysis to get a sense of the current landscape of digital products & services focused on cultural orientation and crisis relief. We needed to understand what other services were doing, how they were doing it, and who they were doing it for. When it came to the products themselves, we took stock of everythingâ€”supported languages, device platforms, geo-location services, security protocols, any personalization or gamification elements, and much more.

### <span style="color: black;">Key takeaways</span>
Many apps needed to support a multitude of different languages and that was no different for us. Safeguarding against any translation mishaps and ensuring that content is **clear, concise, and communicated effectively across languages** became a priority.
<br>
<br>

## <span style="color: black;">Provisional personas</span>
We moved into a series of personas to build consensus around our intended audiences and their respective wants, needs, and frustrations. This was less of a design tool and more so an exercise that helped us summarize our findings from our stakeholder interviews and surveys. Our three main archetypes were refugees, CO trainers overseas, and case workers in the US.

## <span style="color: black;">Synthesizing our findings</span>
Upon completion of the initial discovery phase, we arrived at a set of strategic insights that ultimately defined our UX and design direction for the entire product:

# <span style="color: black;">Designing the experience</span>
## <span style="color: black;">Choosing a model</span>
One of first hurdles we needed to overcome was creating a framework for providing CO content to refugees and ensure knowledge was being retained and applied to real world scenarios encountered during the acclimation period. We used some the current methods employed by CO trainers and case workers in resettlement agencies as a jumping off point, but later [hit the books](https://www.amazon.com/Instructional-Design-Theories-Models-Overview/dp/0898592755/ref=asc_df_0898592755/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=312154648235&hvpos=1o2&hvnetw=g&hvrand=15249990192646968884&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9061285&hvtargid=pla-492656950516&psc=1) and took to the internet to research effective teaching/learning models.


After a bit of hallway testing, we implemented the [Tell, Show, Do, Apply](https://elearningindustry.com/tell-show-do-apply-the-anatomy-of-good-instruction) learning model as a lesson framework for its proven ability to facilitate repetition and help users retain information over time. The sheer simplicity and efficacy of the Tell, Show, Do, Apply model naturally lends itself to mobile app design. This framework served as our North Star when deciding how to approach content for our lessons.

<p class="tc f6 pb3">The Instruct and Assess framework helped us determine where to place instructional content and when to follow up with quizzes and real world application.</p>

## <span style="color: black;">Giving control the user</span>
To many, refugee resettlement is a sensitive, controversial processâ€”especially from a privacy standpoint. Due to user confidentiality precautions, it was too risky to store personal information in the application. Instead, we made it easy for users to skip around to lessons that interest them or pick up where they left without having to log in.
